NAME
    Module::Install::ProvidesClass - provides detection in META.yml for
    'class' keyword

SYNOPSIS
     use inc::Module::Install 0.79;

     all_from 'lib/My/Module/Which/Uses/MooseXDeclare';

     auto_provides_class;
     WriteAll;

DESCRIPTION
    This class is designed to populate the "provides" field of META.yml
    files so that the CPAN indexer will pay attention to the existance of
    your classes, rather than blithely ignoring them.

    The version parsing is basically the same as what M::I's
    "->version_form" does, so should hopefully work as well as it does.

    Currently we only support 'class' as the keyword to look for. This will
    certainly need changing to be configurable since MooseX::Declare allows
    "role" as a keyword to create role classes.
